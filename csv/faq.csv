1@"What Age Do People Get Their First Periods?"@"Most girls get their first periods between the ages of 11 and 14, but you might be younger or older than that when you get yours—there's no "right" age to get it. Ask your mother when she got her first period. It's a good indication of when yours might come."
2@"What Are the Signs That Your Period is Coming?"@"The signs are a little different for everyone, and as you get older, you'll get really good at reading your body. Some things to look for, though, are sore breasts, back pain, cranky moods, constipation, a bloated belly, depression, a big appetite, and a breakout of a couple zits. You won't experience all of these symptoms before your period every month, but you might experience some."
3@"What Can You Do About the Pain?"@"When you've got your period, sometimes the best thing you can do is take a bath, put on some sweats, and relax. To lessen the pain, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers, herbal tea, meditation, or placing a hot water bottle on your belly. You might also want to stay away from greasy or spicy foods."
4@"Can You Delay Your Period From Coming or Stop It Once It's Started?"@"There's no natural way to change the day of your period or make it end more quickly. There are some birth control pills out there that can make your period only come a couple of times a year, but those aren't safe for everyone, and they come with some side effects that you might think are worse than getting your period once a month. Talk to your doctor if you're thinking about trying birth control pills."
5@"What Does It Mean If You Have Irregular Periods?"@"Most women's cycles are around 28 days, but different women might have different cycles and your own schedule might change from month to month due to stress, sickness, or a change in your weight. The first two years after you get your first period can be especially irregular; you might even skip whole months. As long as you get your period eventually, it's not a big deal."
6@"Can You Get Pregnant While On Your Period?"@"Yes, if you have unsafe vaginal sex, you can get pregnant during any part of your menstrual cycle, including when you're on your period. To make sure that doesn't happen, you need to practice safe sex and use a condom every single time you have sex."
